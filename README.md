# Visual-Tracking
Visual tracking algorithms implemented under Matlab environment

These are some tracking algorithms implemented under matlab environment. 
You can download the code, put in a directory and put a sequence in that same folder (e.g: a folder that contains frames of the famous car sequence), run the code and you should be good to go!

I might add more trackers in the future :)
